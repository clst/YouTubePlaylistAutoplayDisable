YouTubePlaylistAutoplayDisable
==============================

**Why won't it stay OFF?!?**

**Note:**
*Timing has been fixed, should now toggle reliably*

This functionality has now also been included in this excellent script: https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter
In YouTubeCenter it will also work for playlists where the autoplay button is not visible, something this script cannot do

---

This userscript will turn playlist autoplay off with every state change.  
Tested with
*  Tampermonkey and Chrome/Blink/Sleipnir
*  Greasemonkey and FireFox

does not rely on jQuery or any other JS Libraries. Just pure ECMAScript.

Another really annoying feature of YouTube fixed.
