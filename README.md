YouTubePlaylistAutoplayDisable
==============================

**Why won't it stay OFF?!?**

This userscript will turn playlist autoplay off with every state change.  
Tested only in Tampermonkey and with Chrome/Blink/Sleipnir

does not rely on jQuery or any other JS Libraries. Just pure ECMAScript.

Another really annoying feature of YouTube fixed.
