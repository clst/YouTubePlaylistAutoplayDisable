YouTubePlaylistAutoplayDisable
==============================

**Why won't it stay OFF?!?**

This userscript will turn playlist autoplay off with every state change.  
Tested with
*  Tampermonkey and Chrome/Blink/Sleipnir
*  Greasemonkey and FireFox

does not rely on jQuery or any other JS Libraries. Just pure ECMAScript.

Another really annoying feature of YouTube fixed.
