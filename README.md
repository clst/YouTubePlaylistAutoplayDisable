YouTubePlaylistAutoplayDisable
==============================

This is currently non-functional since YouTube decided to remove the underlying functionality
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why won't it stay OFF?!?**

**Note:**
*This will not work reliably when SPF (top red loading bar) is enabled.*
*You can use this work-around: https://openuserjs.org/scripts/JoeSimmons/YouTube_-_Disable_Red_Bar_aka_SPF*

This functionality has now also been included in this excellent script: https://github.com/YePpHa/YouTubeCenter
In YouTubeCenter it will also work for playlists where the autoplay button is not visible, something this script cannot do

---

This userscript will turn playlist autoplay off with every state change.  
Tested with
*  Tampermonkey and Chrome/Blink/Sleipnir
*  Greasemonkey and FireFox

does not rely on jQuery or any other JS Libraries. Just pure ECMAScript.

Another really annoying feature of YouTube fixed.
